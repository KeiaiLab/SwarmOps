//! Operation requests and responses, and [`StoreOps`], the boundary every store implements
//! (operations spec §0–§1, §7).
//!
//! Requests and responses alike ignore fields they do not know: the operations spec (§0) forbids
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, so stores and clients of different versions keep working together.
//! Absent options are omitted, never written as null. Ids are lowercase hex. Apart from where a
//! store lives ([`InitReq::path`], [`RepoInfo::path`]), no type names a filesystem location;
//! [`ContentInput::File`] is resolved to bytes on the client before a request reaches the store.
