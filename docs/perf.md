# Performance ledger

Numbers measured on this host (WSL2, kernel 5.15, ext4 on the virtual disk `/dev/sdd`, 32 cores). Re-measure after any storage-layer change; `just bench` fails on >20 % regression once `bench/thresholds.toml` exists (M9).

## M0 fsync latency (2026-10-15)

Two instruments, same 4 KiB-file-per-iteration workload, each variant in its own fresh temporary directory under `~/.local/state/swarmops-bench`:

- `crates/swarmops-store/tests/fsync_percentiles.rs` (`cargo nextest run -p swarmops-store --run-ignored all -E 'test(fsync_percentiles)' --no-capture`): **1,000 independent writes per variant, every write timed on its own** — the table below is from this run; percentiles are nearest-rank over the 1,000 per-write durations.
- `crates/swarmops-store/benches/fsync_latency.rs` (`cargo bench -p swarmops-store`): criterion means for regression tracking only (criterion reports per-sample means over tens of iterations, which smooths tails; it cannot give per-write percentiles).

| variant | p50 | p90 | p99 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| write only, no fsync | 23 µs | 74 µs | 154 µs | 379 µs |
| write + `sync_data` | 4.12 ms | 4.70 ms | 5.91 ms | 26.6 ms |
| write + `sync_all` | 4.09 ms | 4.54 ms | 5.41 ms | 7.36 ms |
| write + `sync_all` + rename + directory fsync | 7.63 ms | 8.32 ms | 9.25 ms | 16.8 ms |

Criterion means for the same variants: 49 µs, 4.07 ms, 4.01 ms, 8.81 ms (consistent with the medians above).

**Decision.** p99 of a durable single-file write is 5.4 ms (max 7.4 ms over 1,000 writes), under the 20 ms threshold the M0 plan set, so **no `--durability fast` flag is introduced now**; the default stays full fsync (objects `sync_all` + one directory fsync per commit + SQLite `synchronous=FULL`). The rename + directory-fsync path has a 16.8 ms max, so a commit's single directory fsync can occasionally approach the threshold; that is one fsync per commit, not per object.

**Consequence for M1.** A commit that writes N new objects pays ~4 ms per object if the fsyncs are serial (100 files ≈ 0.4 s), which cannot meet the "≤ 5 ms + 0.3 ms per changed file" commit target. `FsObjectStore::put_batch` must issue the per-file fsyncs in parallel (rayon) and fsync each touched fan-out directory once at `flush()`. M1 measures `put_batch` throughput at 1, 8 and 32 concurrent fsyncs (`benches/put_batch.rs`); if the virtual disk serializes flushes (throughput does not scale), the `--durability fast` option (skip per-object fsync, keep the SQLite WAL fsync, documented as "safe against process crash, not power loss") is reconsidered with that measurement attached here.
